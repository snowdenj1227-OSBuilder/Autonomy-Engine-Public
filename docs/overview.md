# Autonomy Engine — Overview

This is a **public documentation shell** for AE. It explains the concepts behind the substrate and how partners can build **vertical OS packs** and **connectors** without access to the private runtime.

## AE Layers

1. **Experience Layer** — Operator UI, Prompt→Business flows, dashboards
2. **Domain Layer** — AESL packs (e.g., Freelancer OS, Real Estate Agent OS)
3. **Core Substrate** — Router, governance, ethics engine, marketplace
4. **Systems Layer** — Observability, keys, storage adapters, ledger

## Design Tenets

- **Cheapest‑Sufficient Routing** — always pick the minimal‑cost model/tool that meets quality thresholds.
- **Governed Autonomy** — actions must pass policy gates; human‑in‑loop where risk > threshold.
- **Provenance First** — every action emits a proof into IAEL with Truth Mesh tags.
- **Operator Sovereignty** — operator owns data/config; AE is portable and provider‑agnostic.
