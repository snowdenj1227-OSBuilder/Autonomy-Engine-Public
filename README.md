# Autonomy Engine — Public Overview

> **Autonomy as Sovereignty.** A provider‑agnostic substrate that turns intent into action: orchestrating models, APIs, and tools with verifiable ethics, governance, and cost control. This public repo is a **documentation shell** — the production codebase is private and available under NDA.

## What is Autonomy Engine (AE)?

AE is a **multi‑model orchestration substrate** with an **intent → plan → action** stack. It routes tasks to the *cheapest‑sufficient* model or tool, supervises agents, and records **cryptographic provenance** for every action.

**Core Pillars**
- **AESL (Autonomy Engine Scripting Language):** declarative DAGs for agent/tool workflows.
- **Control Plane:** policy router, token budgets, semantic caching, observability.
- **Governance:** Probabilistic Governance (PG) + Capability Gates (GCG) + Consciousness Protocol (CP).
- **Security:** Layered Substrate Defense (LSD), Zero‑Knowledge Execution (ZKE), Autonomous Keys (AKMS), Immutable Audit & Event Ledger (IAEL).
- **Truth Mesh:** provenance tags, cross‑model consensus, reputation ledger, transparency API.
- **Economy:** AI‑credit pools, marketplace packs, routing to local/cloud models to control unit costs.

> AE’s mission: **operator‑owned data, verifiable safety, luxury‑modern UX.**

## Why AE exists (the problem)

Modern “AI + automation” stacks are **fragile** (glue scripts, opaque agents, vendor lock‑in). Teams need:
- **Determinism:** workflows that can be replayed and audited
- **Safety:** policy‑enforced actions and verified ethics
- **Cost control:** automatic routing to the cheapest sufficient capability
- **Portability:** provider‑agnostic adapters
- **Proofs:** cryptographic provenance of what ran, where, and why

AE is the **substrate layer** that provides those guarantees.

---

## Key Capabilities (non‑exhaustive)

- **Prompt → Business**: translate high‑level goals into deployable workflows (e.g., *“Spin up a POD T‑shirt microbrand under $500 and auto‑optimize ads”*).
- **Multi‑Model Router**: GPT/Gemini/local models; semantics + cost‑aware routing.
- **Agent Governance**: permissions, scopes, capability gates, human‑in‑the‑loop thresholds.
- **Truth Mesh**: provenance tags on every artifact (asset_id, model/version, prompt hash, source refs) + cross‑model consensus.
- **Ethical Guardrails**: Narrative‑Ethics Policy Compiler → probabilistic weights → runtime filters.
- **Observability**: per‑agent latency/cost, anomaly detection, semantic cache hit‑rate.
- **Security‑by‑Architecture**: passkeys + MFA, device binding, signed artifacts, zero‑knowledge attestations.
- **Marketplace**: verified vertical packs (Freelancer OS, Real Estate Agent OS, Home Health OS, Student OS, etc.).

See **[`/docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md)** for the guided tour.
