# Architecture (High-Level)

## Intent → Plan → Action

- **Intent ingestion** → natural‑language + structured constraints
- **AESL plan** → declarative DAG with typed contracts and idempotency
- **Policy router** → routes each node to models/tools under constraints
- **Execution** → Agents & adapters with capability gates
- **Proofs** → Truth Mesh tags + IAEL ledger entry per action
- **Governance** → Probabilistic Governance balances autonomy vs risk

## Governance & Ethics

- **Narrative‑Ethics Policy Compiler** → compiles values into weighted constraints
- **Gates**: Sensitive‑action hold, spend caps, data boundary checks
- **Transparency API**: hashes & proofs available for external audit

## Security

- **LSD** layered defenses; **ZKE** attestations; **AKMS** for secrets
- **Signed artifacts**, **immutable audit**, **session hardening**

## Marketplace

- Verified packs with signed manifests and capability declarations
